# StockAI
Project for an ENSICAEN course.

The goal was to get first sight of what is artificial intelligence and how it could be applied to stock market prediction. 
Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the project yet as AI and the stock market are two big subjects we do not master.

It was still an interesting project to work on and we learned a lot of things in a little time.
